## Summary
Hello unik lovers, 

My name is Quentin (aka @qsvtr), a French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· student in IT interested by cybersecurity, blockchain and cryptocurrencies.  
I am a fervent supporter of the uns.network project since October 2019 with the tesnet.    
Like all of us I'm involved in the protection of personal data and privacy life, that's why I chose to be delegate and to secure the network.

To follow my performance you can check my uptime [here](https://stats.uptimerobot.com/RBv5QfrYMv) (since June 1st 2021)

## Rewards
I plan to donate part of my earnings to those who will support me, I will keep you posted :)
