## Summary

Hello unik lovers,

My name is Quentin (aka @qsvtr), a French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· student in IT interested by cybersecurity and decentralized networks.  
I am a fervent supporter of the unikname.network project since October 2019 with the testnet.  
Like all of us I'm involved in the protection of personal data and privacy life, that's why I chose to be delegate and to secure the network.
