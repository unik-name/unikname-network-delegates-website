## Summary
Hello there,

My name is cactus1549, I’m twenty two and I’m currently studying Computer engineering at university. I like coding, planes and tech stuff in general, including crypto.

I joined the DPoS community more than two years ago with a few ark fork projects. During this time, I have run several delegates and I have gained enough experience to understand how to do it properly. I’m currently running a delegate for Ark, Compendia, Hydra and unikname.
