## Summary
Hello everyone,

My name is Hoani CROSS, Iâ€™m a tahitian senior software architect and developer. I'm found of crypto since 2013. I'm also interested in arts, 3d printers and electronics.

I joined the Unikname community as a delegate early in 2021, thanks top @a_lasselle (we work in the same company). I think this crypto is really interesting.
