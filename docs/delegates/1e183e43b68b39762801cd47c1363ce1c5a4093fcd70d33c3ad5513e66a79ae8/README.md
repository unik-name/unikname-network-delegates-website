## Summary
Hello.. My name is Muzaffer Taylan. I live in Izmir Turkey. I have a PhD in Biotechnology. I am a partner of a company that produces synthetic bone grafts.
I believe that Blockchains and Decentralized technologies will be much more important in our lives. That's why @unikname, a decentralized authorization system 
developed to use decentralized technologies securely, impressed me a lot and I wanted to be a part of this network.
I have prepared a website in order to be transparent to those who support me and to manage the whole process easily.
I would be very happy if you would review my website (http://mtaylan.inova.company) and support me.
